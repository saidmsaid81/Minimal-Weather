# Minimal-Weather

This is a simple Android App that shows the current weather data and a forecast of the next three days. You can add any location and the weather for that location will be displayed

#### Reasons for building this project

- Learning new technologies
- Experimenting with new technologies

**This project uses**

- Kotlin
- [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for locally storing data
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for API calls
- [MVVM architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture)
- [Navigation components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) for navigation

The weather data is from [Dark Sky Api](https://darksky.net/dev) (Which will soon end its API support in favour for Apple WeatherKit)

The Location data is from [Google's Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview)

Weather Icons are from [https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)

To build your own APK, you will need Dark Sky API key and Geocoding API key. Unfortunately, Dark Sky does not allow for new sign ups but I am thinking of migrating the project to Openweather map in future.
